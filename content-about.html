    I started building websites for clients while I was studying at Nelson College. After graduating, I went on an adventure that lead me to becoming a qualified snowboard instructor in Wanaka.<br><br>
    I moved to Wellington to find more work opportunities and take my skills to the next level. When I'm not working on the next big idea, you'll often find me outside at the beach or skating around town.<br><br>
    Get in touch with me if you have an idea that I can help you with.
