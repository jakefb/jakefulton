    I also enjoy ther activities such as snowboarding, freebording, running, exploring the outdoors, and listening to interesting music.<br><br>
    In 2015, I graduated from Nelson College Secondary School, gaining University Entrance. In 2016, I lived in Wanaka for the winter season, attending the Rookies Academy Ski and Snowboard Instructor Course. During the season I gained my NZSIA Ski and SBINZ Snowboard Level One Instructor Certifications. While I was living in Wanaka I worked for a few clients developing websites, including a website for Dovedale.<br><br>
    I have recently moved to Wellington from Nelson. I am currently looking for more clients to work with and build up my portfolio. If you need a website built, improved or maintained please get in touch with me. I would love to help you out.
