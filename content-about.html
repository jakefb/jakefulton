    I have graduated from Nelson College Secondary School, gaining University Entrance. After I finished school I lived in Wanaka for a season and trained to become a ski and snowboard instructor. While I was living in Wanaka I worked developing websites and improving my skillset.<br><br>
    I am currently living in Wellington. The websites I build have been designed from the ground up to look clean and portray the message that your business needs to get across. If you need a website built, improved or maintained get in touch with me.
